# IREE Metal PJRT Plugin - Expected Passing JAX Tests
#
# This file lists JAX tests that are expected to pass on the IREE Metal backend.
# The test runner (test_jax.py) uses this as a baseline for regression detection:
# - If an expected test fails, CI fails (regression)
# - If a new test passes (not in this list), it's reported but CI passes
#
# To generate/update this file:
# 1. Run test_jax.py with passing output:
#    JAX_PLATFORMS=iree_metal python test/test_jax.py \
#      /path/to/jax/tests/api_test.py \
#      -j 4 -t 120 -p metal_expected_passing.txt
#
# 2. Review and commit the updated file
#
# Format: test_file.py::TestClass::test_method
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Initial baseline - to be populated after first successful test run
# Start with empty baseline to bootstrap, then add passing tests incrementally
